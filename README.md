# Steps to deploy oc-gate on OCP cluster

## 1 - Create test dir and populate it with SSL certs:

$ mkdir test

$ openssl genrsa -out test/key.pem
``` bash
Generating RSA private key, 2048 bit long modulus (2 primes)
..............+++++
..............................+++++
e is 65537 (0x010001)
$
```

$ openssl req -new -x509 -sha256 -key test/key.pem -out test/cert.pem -days 3650
``` bash
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
-----
Country Name (2 letter code) [US]:
State or Province Name (full name) []:
Locality Name (eg, city) [Default City]:
Organization Name (eg, company) [Default Company Ltd]:
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:
Common Name (eg, your name or your server's hostname) []:
Email Address []:
$
```

$ ls test
``` bash
cert.pem  key.pem
$
```

2- Login into OCP cluster to deploy oc-gate app:

$ oc login https://api.ocp4.xxx.xxx:6443
Authentication required for https://api.ocp4.xxx.xxx:6443 (openshift)
Username: xxxx
Password: 
Login successful.

You have access to xx projects, the list has been suppressed. You can list all projects with ' projects'

Using project "default".

## Running using ODK internal OAuth2 server

When running using OKD (Openshift) OAuth issuer, operator does not need to provide a k8s service acount token,
the internal OAuth2 server will issue tokens that can be verified by the cluster.

./oc-gate --help
```
